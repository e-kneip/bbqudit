Lil bugs:
 -> should be using the Hx, Hy to make tanner instead of polys?
 -> am I modelling qudit errors right? i.e. with some prob an error occurs and which of Z^k (or X^k) is uniform also for CNOT only do (XY)^k not X^kY^k'
 -> err_cnt might be completely wrong as doing += 1 when apply X^k (or Z^k) error...
 -> some examples have no logicals...

Big bugs:
 -> not doing mod in power (ie mod the width of the patch, l, m), will need to extend length of row of coefficients to width of patch and then roll


DISTANCE ESTIMATE
-----------------
 -> do decoder with one row =1 so finds low weight logical
 -> do a big for loop multiplying logicals with stabilisers and checking the weight and take minimum

LOGICALS
--------
 -> check n-m=k where m is independent stabilisers to make sure all okay in find logicals function

SIMULATION
----------
 -> write decoder...
 -> SIMPLIFY: do just one cycle of syndrome measurement (ie no syndrome history) and one iteration


Help idk what's happening
-------------------------
 -> toric code over field 5 only has logical ops for some sizes, e.g. does for 2x2 but not 3x3. Would expect there is always the logical XXX..., ZZZ... on horizontal/vertical


DO THIS NEXT
------------
 -> check all the hx_eff used in x_check, is it right way around?
 -> is the p being redefined in func inside dosd so that doesnt need -= 1000?
 -> does dosd ever fail ie do we need to say whether it was successful?
 -> why do we do 2 noise free cycles at end?


FUTURE DIRECTIONS
-----------------
 -> find distance exactly
 -> know when the qudit generalisation makes non-0 k
