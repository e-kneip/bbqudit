Lil bugs:
 -> should be using the Hx, Hy to make tanner instead of polys?
 -> am I modelling qudit errors right? i.e. with some prob an error occurs and which of Z^k (or X^k) is uniform also for CNOT only do (XY)^k not X^kY^k'
 -> err_cnt might be completely wrong as doing += 1 when apply X^k (or Z^k) error...

Big bugs:
 -> not doing mod in power (ie mod the width of the patch, l, m), will need to extend length of row of coefficients to width of patch and then roll


DISTANCE ESTIMATE
-----------------
 -> do decoder with one row =1 so finds low weight logical
 -> do a big for loop multiplying logicals with stabilisers and checking the weight and take minimum


DO THIS NEXT
------------
 -> check all the hx_eff used in x_check, is it right way around?
 -> why do we do 2 noise free cycles at end?
 -> initialisation of bbcode uses qubit instead of qudit!!!


FUTURE DIRECTIONS
-----------------
 -> find distance exactly
 -> know when the qudit generalisation makes non-0 k


FOR PRESENTATION
----------------
 -> find parameters of Gross code esque
